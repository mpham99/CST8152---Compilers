# CST8152---Compilers
Course Description

Introduction to the basic principles, techniques, and tools used to translate text expressed in one language to
equivalent text expressed in another language. The concepts discussed and the programming concepts studied in
previous courses are applied to develop and program the front-end of a simple compiler or interpreter using ANSI C
as implementation language. The ideas and techniques discussed could be applied to general software design and
to parsing of structured files, such as HTML, XML, register and configuration files.

Assignments Description

Written in C, the programs implement the front-end of a compilers for a faux programming language called "PLATYPUS".
During this process, it requires creating a finite state machine with a transition table as a part of the lexical analyzer,
which used to recognize tokens from a source documents. Using predictive top down parsing method to implement a syntax analyzer
by fixing the context-free grammar of the language to change the left recursion and do some left factoring, as well as using FIRST
sets for each non-terminal.
